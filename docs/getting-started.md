# Getting Started

## About ExtraSkills

**ExtraSkills** is an RPG-like Spigot plugin for your Minecraft server that will add **vanilla-like skills** for your players, as well as some **abilities** and **powerful passives**.

It's inspired by a lot of plugins out here but it provides a lot of new features such as new abilities or a **completely customizable leveling experience**.

The configuration itself can be deep, yet simple to use and comprehend.

:::caution
This plugin **doesn't ship with extra stats**, such as _"Intelligence"_ or _"Strength"_, due to the vanilla-nature orientation of this plugin.

If you are looking for this kind of plugin, please check [**EcoSkills** (paid)](https://plugins.auxilor.io/ecoskills) or [**AureliumSkills** (free)](https://wiki.aurelium.dev/skills/) who are both great alternatives.

## Why should I use this plugin?

Almost everything is configurable so that it can fit easily the vision of your server.

You can edit the leveling experience of your skills, edit, toggle and tweak abilities values, and so on...

This plugin also ships with a great default configuration.

## Support

You can join the [ExtraSkills Support Discord Server](https://discord.gg/4xYZQ9b3ar) to ask questions or to report bugs.

:::info
I am the only one developer working on this plugin **for free**, during my free-time.

It means **I may take some time to answer your questions**, but I will try to answer them as soon as possible.

Thanks for your patience.
